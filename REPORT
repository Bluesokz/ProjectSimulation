Artificial life and evolution attempts to reproduce what can be considered the most complicated thing in the natural world; life. Life can be broken down into four levels of organisation, beginning with molecular and cellular then progressing to organismic and population levels [C. Langton 1997]. According to C. Langton, studies at the time showed “a tendency to study the molecular level through wetware experiments, the cellular and population levels with software experiments, and the organismic level with hardware (robotic)”. These tendencies have changed with the changes in technology over the fifteen years since this book was published and modern studies are capable of modelling the evolution of organisms with software. Experiments such as 'Flexible Muscle-Based Locomotion for Bipedal Creatures' [T. Geitenbeek et al 2013] show the how complex organismic structures can be found through basic artificial evolution and echo what we see in the natural world.
	My own work is to be centred around the evolution of plants in an artificial ecosystem, with a focus on aesthetic representation, and discover how complex the system can become at various levels of human intervention.
